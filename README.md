This repository contains an intermediate SQL exam I completed for my Data Fundamentals class, part of an overall data engineering technical education program.

The work you see here was completed individually, before being checked against peer exams to facilitate learning and exchange of best practice. To perserve the security of those class servers, tables and transformations in this file are not attached to any particular schema or database.

In this class, SQL mastery was expected before moving on to the secondary and tertiary aspects of the course, setting up automated, triggered, or manual data transformation pipelines and then orchestrating data processing across parallel server clusters. 

The intent of this file is to display my SQL skills, problem solving process, documentation and code readibility. As a data consultant, I'm not able to share everything I worked on, but this gives a good idea of the problems I'm comfortable with.
