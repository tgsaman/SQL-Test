This repository contains an intermediate SQL exam I completed for my Data Fundamentals class, part of an overall data engineering technical education program.

The work you see here was completed individually, before being checked against peer exams to facilitate learning and exchange of best practice. To perserve the security of those class servers, tables and transformations in this file have been engineered to plugin to any SQL Server you have access to. This practice exam will create it's own DBO and Schema on run, if you'd like to do that.

In this class, SQL mastery was expected before moving on to the secondary and tertiary aspects of the course, setting up automated, triggered, or manual data transformation pipelines and then orchestrating data processing across parallel server clusters. This repo is meant to only display the SQL fundamentals behind that skillset.

The intent of this file is to display my SQL knowledge, problem solving process, notes/documentation practices and code readibility. As a data consultant, I'm not able to share everything I worked on, but this gives a good idea of the problems I'm comfortable solving and how I go about sharing those solutions with others.
