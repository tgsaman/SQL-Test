This repository contains an intermediate SQL exam I completed for a Data Fundamentals class, part of my technical education. You should be able to check my work with just a few clicks, if you've got a SQL server running. 

REQUIREMENTS:
A SQL server compatible with T-SQL commands

TO RUN:
Connect to your preferred server and run this through the command line or an application like Azure Data Studio, and you should get a new database (TomsTestDB), a new schema (TomsTest), a set of tables with foreign key relationships, and a readout of 5 queries. 

The work you see here was completed individually, before being checked against peer exams to facilitate learning and exchange of best practices. To perserve the security of those class servers, tables and transformations in this file have been engineered to plugin to any SQL Server you have access to. You can test your own knowledge by branching and deleting my queries between table setups.

In this class, SQL mastery was expected before moving on to the secondary and tertiary aspects of the course, setting up automated, triggered, or manual data transformation pipelines and then orchestrating data processing across parallel server clusters. This repo is meant to only display the SQL fundamentals behind that skillset. The intent of this file is to display my SQL skills, problem solving process, documentation and code readibility. As a data consultant, I'm not able to share everything I worked on, but this gives a good idea of the problems I'm comfortable solving on any given day.
